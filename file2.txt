As it stands, you are no longer my friend
Eat my heart, take my soul
Let it burn you (I won't let go)
What's on my mind? Well, I'm the farthest gone, you'll find
You should take a look inside
You should tear apart my mind

I won't fall down, you need me
We don't follow crowds, we mold them new
I'm not done, believe me
Wе won't settle down, we'll makе them move
Make them mine
